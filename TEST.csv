5,"We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!",Very nice hotel

1,"Hotellihuone oli ullakolla, jossa ei pystynyt kvelemn suorassa. Huonekorkeus oli suurimmassa osassa n. 1,5m. Huoneestamme varastettiin rannekoru ja neuletakki. Lisksi Spa ei ollut hotellissa vaan n. kilometrin pss toisessa hotellissa. Laivalaiturilta oli kilometrin matka hotelliin. Lidon saari on kyll hyv majoituspaikka kun vierailee Venetsiassa, mutta en suosittele tt hotellia.",Hotellihuone oli pettymys
1,"DON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes"
5,"We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",Excellent hotel with good access to Venice
4,"Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern. Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle. Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus, da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war. Das Warten auf den nchsten Bus htte mitunter lnger gedauert, als zu Fu zu dem Anleger zu gehen.","Sch��ne Lage, ruhige Gegend"
5,"Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.",Lovely stay - second time staying at this hotel.
5,"Das Hotel liegt auf der Insel Lido neben Venedig, direkt am Meer mit Blick auf Venedig. Lido kann man sehr gut mit den Booten erreichen. Vom Bootsanlegeplatz sind es ca. 400 m zum Hotel an der Kste entlang. Den Weg mussten wir zu Fu zurcklegen, da keine Busse wegen einer Baustelle dorthin fahren. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen, berhaupt war das Personal im Hotel sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war gemtlich eingerichtet, das Bad relativ gro und alles sehr sauber und ordentlich. Auch mit dem Frhstcksbffet waren wir sehr zufrieden - gute Qualitt und relativ groe Auswahl. Wir waren rundherum zufrieden und wrden das Hotel sofort wieder buchen.",Tolles Hotel f��r einen St��dtetrip nach Venedig
5,"Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!",A good Hotel on the Lido - Quiet location.

5,"Stayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.",I would come back

4,This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.,Excellent Service

4,"Htel trs bien situ dans un coin calme loin de l'agitation frntique du centre de Venise, mais seulement quelques minutes de bateau. Les chambres conomiques sous toit ne sont pas trs ergonomiques cause de la pente de toit et il fait vite chaud s'il y a du soleil lorsque l'air conditionn ne fonctionne pas encore, comme lors des congs de Pques. La vue extrieure se limite aux velux. La TV n'est pas un cran plat. On s'attend un peu plus de luxe dans un 4 toiles, mais les prix sont contenus.

2,"Walls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it.",Gezellig hotel
3,"If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.","Good option, great staff, quiet neighborhood"
4,"Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain.",Decent Hotel on Lido

4,This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.,Great view
5,"Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.",Good pleasant pick

I know this is not rare but any place that does has told me. I ended up calling trying to get it refunded. The breakfast in morning was pretty good, they had a full buffet not just some pakage pastries. Leave your swimsuit at home though the pool is small very small.",Outside is rather boring but inside is nice.
5,Great stay for our night downtown Livermore at Bankhead Theater concert. Birthday celebration for friend. The most comfortable bed ever! Nice patio where we spent our morning catching up. Hotel under construction did not bother us.,livermore- Bankhead Theater trip

4,"The hotel was great. There was little construction going on which altered where they served breakfast, but it didn't bother us any.",Winetasting Trip
3,"Having never been to Livermore, imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure. I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced.",Not what I expected

5,Close to freeway on/off ramp. enjoyed the stay,Highway to Hawthorn
2,"This hotel was promoted as being in the wine country. However, it was a block from the freeway. When we asked the desk clerk about this, she pointed her finger toward the door and said, It's about 4 miles that way. We had a great view of Jack in the Box parking lot. When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes, we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet. After working out and returning to our room at 9am, there was no hot water for the shower. The breakfast was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly.",Did not live up to our expectations
5,Came for concert at Wente. Last time I traveled to area the accomodations had a shuttle service. That would be a nice amenity if you could add it. Great clean place to stay.,Did not live up to our expectations
4,"Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat. Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating.",Tournament Notice at the Hotel
4,It was cold in the room. We couldn't get the heater on easily for some reason but then when the heat temperature finally came on we were sweating in the middle of the night. I would like a better thermostat or better direction. The hot breakfast was great!!!,Tournament Notice at the Hotel
3,"All the rooms have been recently renovated. They are in the process of renovating the lobby area. The room was new and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bed linen looks new too. Its also nice to have electrical sockets at desk level and plenty of them. The breakfast was so so... eggs, sausages and hashbrown (no fruits) but barely edible.",Being renovated....

5,I must say the GM at this hotel Catherine is the bomb! She was very attentive and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the staff were all very nice to us from the moment we walked in the door. I would stay here every time I'm in California. Thanks again Cat!,Catherine is the best!
4,"The hotel was great, but the Buffet Breakfast was the worst I have ever had! The bacon taste like cardboard, eggs and sausage were cold, Pastries were hard and very little fruit. The only thing hot and worth eating was fixing yourself a waffle at the waffle machine if you didn't mind waiting in line for it.",Great Hotel with a Bad Breakfast
4,"The Hawthorne Suites offers an affordable, comfortable environment that is convenient to the 580 freeway (just south of it) and within a mile and a half of downtown Livermore. Room was incredibly clean and comfortable.

5,"The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were very impressed by the dcor everything was clean and felt very upscale. The hotel is located near the freeway. There is a gas station, fast food, and shopping nearby. We were in town for a family event so we didn't do much exploring, but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area. The best part was the proximity to downtown Livermore. Wonderful shopping and dining opportunities, and only 5 minutes away. Also, the wineries are within a 10 minute drive.

3,There's nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains don't close. I really like the furniture The bedding was clean the pillows are great. Next time I will ask for a room with windows on the other side.,Please fix the curtains!!
4,"The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was very helpful, especially with accommodating us when we asked to check in early. The problem was with cleanliness. Our room was not clean enough - I found a floss stick on the table in our room. What looked like a condom was found when we went to use the spa. And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice large screen tv as well - made my husband happy.",Needs better cleaning service.
2,"Mediocre. The carpets and elevator reek of sour wine. Evidently they have regular wine Thursdays here. Service was somewhat lacking. I requested a wakeup call, they didn't do it. Finally, the free breakfast was on the poor side. Daddy, this bacon tastes like tuna.",Mediocre
5,"Nice experience, despite the re-modeling construction. Friendly and courteous hotel staff. Beautiful new room decor and ambience.",A Great Stay at Hawthorn Suites.
5,"One night only, but a nice one. New renno's high quality throughout. Comfy, modern accomodation. Our room overlooked grazing cattle and the relentless I-580, so it was busy, but totally silent. We'll be back.","One night only, but a nice one. New renno's high quality..."

We made the reservation Friday night, and honestly, was apprehensive because of some of the reviews. Pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, it's had a facelift and looks good. The bathroom tub could use an update...but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. I'd take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs weren't watered down. Sausage was good...bacon...well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one. But the coffee was decent and overall, was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay there...would do it again and would recommend others!

What a mistake ! The motel, although the room was clean and comfortable, was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities. I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation. When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul. So. if the management knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate.

However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still...

If I were to judge the facility by this one person, I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions: no smile, no patience...cranky. However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it. This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacation/family celebration, so I was really hoping for a good time. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, as I own a cleaning service here in MD. Thank you so much for an overall excellent stay!!!",A long awaited getaway to Binghamton!

The corridors reaked of curry/incense and it was obvious other air freshners were used to mask the obvious odors. Not opposed to other cultures but if you are going to have that sort of thing waifing through the hotel you should advertise such.

It's simply criminal to have such a slow and unstable internet connection in 2015. And may be, king size beds that are not to single beds with tendency to move apart.",Great hotel to relax

4,"Das Zimmer glich einer kleinen Ferienwohnung mit seperatem Schlafzimmer, Wohnzimmer mit kleiner Kchenzeile und Bad. Aufenthalt mit Hund war mglich und wurde sogar mit einer kleiner Aufmerksamkeit fr den Vierbeiner noch verschndert. Das Frhstck war sehr lecker und hatte eine reichhaltige Auswahl. Alles war sehr sauber und ordentlich. Lediglich an der Rezeption war ein Mitarbeiter sehr berheblich und patzig. Zuerst wurden wir eingewiesen und es wurde uns ein Parkplatz zugewiesen. Nachdem wir bereits standen und uns auf in den Ortskern machen wollten, hielt uns der Mitarbeiter an und teilte uns mit, dass wir nun pro Nacht fr den Parkplatz 15 zahlen mssten. Auf Nachfrage, warum uns das denn nicht vorher mitgeteilt worden sei, bekamen wir die patzige Antwort, dass das jawohl berall steht und auch auf der Website zu finden sei. Meine Meinung Selbst wenn - ein kundenfreundlicher Mitarbeiter htte 1.) freundlicher Reagiert und 2.) aus Servicegedanken in jedem Fall vorher nochmal darauf hingewiesen. Leider haben wir uns den Namen des Mitarbeiters nicht gemerkt. Die anderen waren jedoch alle sehr freundlich und deutlich hilfsbereiter als dieser eine. Alles in Allem kann man einen Aufenthalt hier sehr empfehlen - wenn man sich ggf. ber die ntigen Informationen selbst und im Vorfeld erkundigt.",Gesamtpaket : sehr zu empfehlen

Negativ war der Parkplatzmangel, ein berforderter Barkeeper am 30.08.2015 und ein fehlender Fahrstuhl in die dritte Etage.

1,"4 1/2 Sterne gebucht und nichts dafr erhalten. Wir haben ein abgewohntes, schmuddeliges Appartment verordnet bekommen. Nebenhaus mit Blick auf Parkplatz. Von Idylle keine Spur. Von mehr als vier Sternen schon gar nicht. Es hatte alles den Charme einer Jugendherberge der neunziger Jahre. Vorsicht: niemand, der das nicht wirklich mag, sollte die Appartments buchen. Gereinigt wird vor Einzug wenig und whrend des Aufenthalts gar nicht. Im Flur stehen im Besenschrank eben Besen und luxurises Toilettenpapier. Ein- oder zweilagig. Zur Selbstbedienung. Wahrer Luxus eben. Bademantel und Slippers sucht man auch vergebens. Das wre auch wirklich zu viel verlangt. Nur weil am Besenschrank noch das Hotel vier Jahreszeiten grt und weil man in der Lobby eben jenes Hotels eincheckt, und auch ganz schnell wieder aus, heit das ja nicht, dass die Unterkunft im Nebengebude auch die fr 4 Sterne gesetzen Standards erfllen muss. Auch wenn die Appartments Mozart und andere klangvolle Namen tragen, sollte man eher nichts erwarten, dann wird man auch nicht allzusehr enttuscht. Vom Namen Mozart ausgehend: es mssen Mozarts letzte Jahre gewesen sein, die in dem zugigen, modrigen Loch in einer dunklen Senke Wiens.",Hotel zum letzten Loch

Unser Zimmer war wie gewnscht mit einem Aufzug erreichbar und hatte auch einen Balkon.

Das WLAN ist sehr langsam und die Aufzugstr schliet mit einem Tempo, welches einer Gesundheitsgefhrdung nahe kommt. Ansonsten sind die Apartments schn und zweckmig eingerichtet.

Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest. As other reviewers mentioned, the valet service was really top notch and on their game. We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again. Thank you for making it a memorable Anniversary!",A must to go for a staycation!
5,We came in for wedding. The staff was exceptional. Loved the workout facility. Will definitely stay again next time we are in Houston.,On the Return List for Sure
5,"The Hotel and its grounds are beautiful, to say the least. Very warm, very welcoming, very grand. The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well. Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar - same level of amazing service. Speaking of the spa - I have never had a spa experience like this. Unbelievable! The ultimate in luxury in relaxation. Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early, just to be on the safe side. They did not charge us the extra night. I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again.",Ultimate Old School Luxury
5,"What a fabulous hotel and resort property . Incredible amenities made our family time relaxing and enjoyable, providing us with the perfect getaway escape and memories !!",Getaway Escape
5,"This is a beautiful hotel with great views and excellent amenities. The Spa staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel front desk staff are not as friendly, yet they are professional. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a luxurious weekend getaway.",Getaway Escape
5,"The valets here are awesome. They greet you with a smile and a sense of urgency to help. They provide cold bottles of water each time you leave. While it may look like this hotel is off the beaten path, I assure you that it is easy to get to and really gets you out of the fray of the Galleria traffic without leaving the neighborhood.",Hidden oasis in the Galleria neighborhood.
5,We had a great time there- beautiful place with wonderful staff. Would love to go again,Awesome place
3,"The hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be. We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake! Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us. Once we finally talked to someone that could help, Kevin, he was extremely short and unpleasant. When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he didn't address us but talked to every other table around us. Hotel was nice, amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is!",Nice hotel for families
5,Excellent hotel - service was beyond anything we have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a place to stay in Houston. Location is tremendous and the surrounding area is beautiful!,Nice hotel for families
5,"Beautiful hotel, but very intimidating!! Hard to figure out where the pools were.",Nice hotel for families
5,"My wife and I stayed at the Houstonian for 3 nights in October. The property was lovely and the room was very comfortable. However the fitness facilities are truly amazing. The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent. My wife also visited the spa and although it was expensive the facilities and service were again of the highest quality.",Amazing Fitness Facilities
5,"We can to town for a college football game and we a little nervous about the room size some complained about, but found it acceptable. The property is beautiful and the staff was a friendly and helpful as it gets. We will stay here again when we retuen to Houston.",Amazing Fitness Facilities
5,"It was like a resort in the middle of Houston. The spa, fitness center and pools were a nice touch that enabled us to stay here and be entertained at the same time. Very nice!",Final summer trip.

5,"Beautiful hotel at a great value! Amazed at what we paid for a room on the concierge floor that included free daily continental breakfast, early evening cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and after dinner dessert buffet. The Olivette restaurant was spectacular - had dinner there both nights. Will definitely be my go-to hotel any time I'm in Houston!",Luxury hotel without the high price!

Business travelers will enjoy the computer data ports in each room and photocopying services.",Great place!
4,"I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful.",Better than I expected
5,"I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff.",Easy access to interstate 95 yet still quite.
3,Adequate but nothing to recommend it.,Perfectly fine but certainly nothing special
3,"We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughter's camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. We'd just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and I'll just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. I'd go back to the Best Western, but I'd suggest you drop the ""grand"" from the name.",Convenient stopover

So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!",Dissappointed
2,"If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that.",there's nothing GRAND here.
4,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.,Great staff- Comfy stay
2,I am a 75yr old Disabled Vet and had requested 2 bed room on first floor as I have walking disability from service. First thing get sent to 2nd floor King. Nobody even read reservation.

Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids.",Easy access to interstate 95 yet still quite.
3,"This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again.","Rooms and Front Staff Good, Amenities Bad"

3,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.",Decent hotel in Waterville
4,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog.

Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge!

3,"The hotel was clean and the people at the front desk are happy to help. Same with the staff that took care of our breakfast order. The French toast was really good, same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad. Stay away from the turkey bacon....overcooked circles of leathery meat.It was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool, that it wasn't worth going in, and that was the reason we choose the hotel.There were hockey, cheer, basketball, and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity",busy time of the year
4,I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again,Traveling for work
3,"Clean, reasonably comfortable, well maintained. Very nice breakfast, extremely reasonable price. If you can get a room facing the courtyard, it is very pleasant and quiet. Like many hotels these days, it seems to be run by kids, who are friendly but not terribly knowledgeable or resourceful. Overall a nice stay, what we expect from Best Western.",Comfortable and quiet

Be sure to get your voucher for basic breakfast which is a hot, fresh breakfast for free! Great coffee. Plenty of parking and close to downtown Waterville for access to restaurants...

3,"The hotel was comfortable. It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers. Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use. The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went.",Close to Colby College
2,We were touring colleges for the week and this was my least favorite hotel. It just did not feel very can and up to date. The location is convenient to Colby.,Just Okay

3,"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair.",Reasonably priced accommodation
5,This was a nice place to stay.,Reasonably priced accommodation
1,"Smell of freshly smoked marijuana in the halls on the way to the pool all day long. Hotel is suppose to be family friendly and staff was walking through the same halls and didn't appear to care. Pool was rented out to a birthday party of non guests to the hotel so overpacked and could not swim. Later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt floating in it. Was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with 4 people. Shower only got luke warm. Free breakfast advertised was not free. ""Free"" is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity. Website and book in room states there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not. They have soda and ice machines only. Very disappointing.",Awful place to stay

5,"I am in Waterville every year for fire department training and always go home disappointed about the local accommodations.  This year my hotel was clean, quiet and very comfortable.  Aside from a bartender who had no personality the stay was perfect.",Nicest option I have found in the Waterville area.
4,"nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased.",close to visit family.
1,Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways. It was like the workers just up and left everything out in the open and materials all over the place. The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains. And the continental breakfast was a joke. My family went down at 8:15 am and they had nothing ready. Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly's next door where it was cleaner.I wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent.,Waterville Grand Hotel

Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore.

Upon check-out I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4, and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days, and gave me a receipt showing that.

4,Staff was very nice and helpful. We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early; the response was very welcoming.My only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping. They use the lock bar to keep the door in-locked while they go in and out to clean. The problem then becomes the constant loud slamming of doors,Great Price

Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if you're in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left. We had to order overpriced cereal and oatmeal and wolf it down.","Nice pool, convenient location"

Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there.

4,The staff was fantastic.  Nice room.  Could have used more than 2 bath towels.  It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter.

The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting.

4,"The Best Western Plus brand is consistently decent, and this hotel did not disappoint. It was nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room- a huge plus!",Consistent - you know what to expect.
5,The hotel was right off the highway but not so close as to experience traffic noises. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. I have stayed at a lot of hotels this year and this one by far was the best. Great bed. Slept like a log and woke refreshed. We ate at the in hotel resteraunt and were extreemly pleased. overall A++,could not have asked for better

5,"We had a good time, restuarant inside the hotel is kind of pricey but besides that it was a good time.",Nice hotel
3,Uninspiring and tired looking...I should have booked the Hotel across the street which looked newer was cheaper...and next to a Starbucks....,Looking run down and in need of a makeover
4,"We found this motel to be pleasant, clean and affordable. Very helpful staff. Attached Irish bar/restaurant we great. The breakfast voucher for the restaurant was a delightful surprise for a real breakfast. I would highly recommend this Best Western",Pretty nice
3,"Ok place, needs some paint and new clean carpet. Stains on bed cover.",OK PLACE
3,"The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair.",OK PLACE
5,"The hotel was under renovations when we got there, that would have been nice to know prior to booking, it just didn't look nice from the outside and some area on the inside also. Other than that the staff were nice and accomodating, it was convenient to have a full restaurant/pub in the hotel, for different optionsat breakfast, not just a continental breakfast bar. The housekeeper cleaned our room when we were out and took a knife and pizza pan that belonged to me (obviously thinking it belonged to the hotel) and the restaurant staff managed to scour the kitchen, find and return them to me before I left (not an easy task to find one knife). All in all it was a nice stay, and I wouldn't mind returning, I would like to see the improvements.",I'd return
4,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.,Great staff- Comfy stay
4,"very convenient for over night stay right off the I 95. restaurant & pub in hotel, gas station across street and other fast food restaurant up the road and a few shopping stores.",convenient & clean

O'Brien's Irish Restaurant and Pub is located on the property and offers a good selection of breakfast and dinner options. My understanding is hat this hotel was recently upgraded, although it is hard to tell colors and... More",BW Plus Waterville Grand Hotel
4,This hotel is used for Winter Romp each year . The cost is not too expensive . The room is a good size . There was two beds in the room. It is in good condition for the price we pay . There is lots of parking . Breakfast was included which was great . Will return again to thus...,Not too expensive
5,Hotel was convenient to I95 and well above average in appearance and appointments. Staff was very gracious and accommodating. We were passing through so one night stay. Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by. Rate was not a bargain but worth the price.,Long way to go
4,"Hotel was good. Indoor pool was the draw AND it was actually very warm. Great job! However, I do NOT recommend eating at the hotel restaurant...HORRIBLE service, so/so food quality. With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it shouldn't have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos, then when it came out, the order was wrong!! Waited another 30 mins for the main dish. Pasta over cooked, chicken rubbery, even my 4 yr old wouldn't eat it. Good stay, but eat elsewhere.","DON'T EAT AT RESTAURANT, but hotel ok"
5,"Conveniently located, very efficient staff, reasonably priced.",close to other destinations
3,Location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from downtown (by car) to Waterville. The only complaint I would voice would be that the outer door that was used for entry to the building in the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock. This added a sense of less security to me as a single traveler.,BW Waterville
1,"To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation, with construction materials everywhere, cluttered throughout, dirty and not well maintained. The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced.No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property. Terrible experience!","""Disappointing end to a long day of travel"""
3,I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly,Dog friendly
3,The hotel was okay the hotel was fine I must put a bunch of words in here to tell you simply that the hotel was okay.,I have to put a title to my review
1,Halls reeked of marijuana. Pool was overpacked with non guests from a birthday party rental. They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.,Awful
5,"My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay, the rooms were VERY clean, the staff courteous and the hospitality OUTSTANDING. Please post these comments, thanks. Joe",A GREAT stay at the Grand hotel
5,"We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated!!! We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!! I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno,d to new hotel!!",Newly Renovated!!
3,"We stayed here for 1 night. Rooms were clean and relatively comfortable.

4,I had a wonderful time at the best Western. My kids loved the pool and jetted spa. The staff where friendly and helpful.,Trip
3,"We have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are ok, the facilities are ok, the staff is terrific. The staff is very friendly and service oriented, they are what keep us coming back. There is a pool and work out area. The restaurant could use some updating. The rooms were clean.",Its a good option
5,We had business to attend to in Waterville,great deal for the weekend
1,"This hotel is absolutely disgusting! You could not pay me to stay here again. We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke!! Rooms are very old and dark. Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot didn't get above Luke warm. The little coffee machine in the room also didn't work..it was just bad all the way around!! I wasn't expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice! Stay elsewhere! !",stay away!!
4,Upgraded motel with an extremely comfortable bed and quiet room on the top (third) floor. We enjoyed our breakfast and the allowance (14) given to cover breakfast. I definitely would consider staying at the Best Western Plus if I was staying in Waterville again.,Surprisingly Nice
5,"My family stayed at this hotel and had a great weekend. The pool was huge and my kids loved it. The restaurant gives you a hot breakfast, not a microwaved one and the rooms were very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I want to thank the staff for a fun weekend away!!!",Great Hotel

4,Hotel Room was clean and comfortable.  We would recommend. We stayed because we were visiting Thomas College.,"Excellent, as always."
1,"All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in.  The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean.  Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services.  They said the housekeepers had all gone home.  The restaurant was terrible service.  One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day.  Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered.  We got our own flatware and coffee.  The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry.  I am allergic.  Had to send it back.  I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called.  Called corporate and they wanted to give me points.  Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a $50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for $50.00  No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.  The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks.",Stay Away From This Property

Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy.

The TV was difficult to use - you couldn't get directly to a specific channel and it didn't have all the network channels, presumably b/c it was DirectTV. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea and muffins so I wouldn't really call it a continental breakfast.",Met my needs

If you're on a tight budget, this place is great. If you're looking for a resort stay and planning on spending your entire trip in the hotel, this is not your place. Bed was great to sleep in, shower was hot to bathe in. All I needed the room for.",Nice hotel close enough to campus without being on

2,"I booked the hotel last minute as I was simply too tired to continue driving. I'm in grad school so I needed cheap. Considering the price, the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected. The staff was friendly enough, the hotel smelled like mildew, serious updates were needed, and the continental breakfast was lacking. The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (I'm assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door. This continued through the night so needless to say, I didn't sleep very well.",You get what you pay for

The second room didn't smell like an ash tray but did have a weird funk to it. There were random hairs find in the room. The ac was having a hard time keeping up on a 75day.

What I couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on, or the toilet that isn't attached to the floor properly, or the drafty window, mildew stained tile, torn curtains, and cracked microwave door. I also wasn't expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs. I wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room, but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning, and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets. Overall, the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and I only needed someplace for 1 night to attend a conference at the university, so it served it's purpose.","Great price, but needs an update"

1,"The only clean thing about this hotel was the check in. We paid (with tax) 155.00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed (no biggie) when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs in-bedded in the cover, the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it. So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed. There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on (coffee and no cups) the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out, the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall. The little doily that I'm assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, I'm sure was there for some time...I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! I'm glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (I'm assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload.

Every simple request required multiple phone calls, and they placed us in a room directly across from daily construction which lasted past 8pm on two occasions, even though we had an infant with us who needed to nap and go to bed early at night. When we asked a manager if we could change rooms, she declined and told us it would end at 5pm that day and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip. It lasted two more full days, and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her. Also, the check-in process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room. However, the restaurants (and their staff) are excellent. I can't say enough about the staff at Blue, as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyone's face. The food at all three dinner restaurants (as well as Chil for lunch) was very good, and service was mostly great throughout. Our room itself was very clean, and the pool areas are fantastic. Also, room service was very fast and was also delicious. It was a shame that the front desk dropped the ball on so many occasions because it really could have been an awesome trip, but it was unfortunately blemished by poor customer service on the front end.",Should Have Been Much Better

4,"El Hotel es lindo y el personal muy amable,la playa es muy cerca de las habitaciones y es muy bueno para familias sin embargo, tienen muchas oportunidades para mejorar. Las cabanas de la playa se deben reservar el dia anterior y no nos avisaron cuando llegamos al hotel, aunque se vende como Gourmet All Inclusive, la comida realmente no es gourmet y las opciones son limitadas. Ofrecen servicio de bebidas y alimentos en la playa y efectivamente existe, pero la persona encargada pasa por la playa cada hora. No tienen servicio de traslado areopuerto-hotel-aeropuerto, hay que contratarlo aparte y el hotel no recomienda a nadie especifico. Parece ser que es algo atipico, pero habia demasiadas algas en el mar, lo bueno es que tenian personal contratado para limpiar la playa todo el tiempo, pero definitivamente no es suficiente. Las posibilidades de alimentacion para bebes, son muy reducidas y aunque efectivamente se pueden hacer solicitudes al chef, es muy demorado el servicio.",Costoso para lo que recibes....

4,Charming hotel. Good food for an all inclusive. Great for kids.,Nice stay
5,"Beautiful hotel with a Kids Club but still maintains that exclusive feel. Staff goes out if their way to please you. All inclusive implies programming, but trust me, they customize things to please their guests. Wonderful food and wine. One of my best hotel experiences ever.",A must visit for families
1,"We made our reservations a month in advance, my wife called on the day we are suppose to check in, gets the run around of whether or not they will have a room or not! Who runs a business like this When they found a room we were given a couple cards, neither of which opened the door. Overall, you have no feeling of security, even if you are parked next to your room i was constantly checking outside on my vehicle.",Horrendous
1,"Attention do not stay here for any reason! If there's no hotels available you'd be better off staying in your vehicle showering a truck stop! They treat their customers like crap, walk in your room w/out permission(waiting for you say anything), try to rush you out the rooms w/the doors open customers aren't dressed. If you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay 25 to get it out won't give you a shuttle ride anywhere until you do. The showers are cold. I told the van driver just a minute after she knocked she swung the door open claiming she didn't hear me. I told her I needed to get dressed she snatched the door open againx2 the curtains while I was getting ready. Don't under any circumstance stay here pleaseyou'll regret it! That star needs to be a negative 5!",Disrespectful amp Rude!!!!!!

3,"Hotel was off the strip, but close to a shortcut to downtown -made it easier to avoid some of the traffic. When I was checking in, lady had a meeting or something to get to, so I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Her replacement was ok, not really friendly, but not rude. Staff was better the next day.",good location - lackluster customer service
3,"This Days Inn is located off the Strip which is what we wanted. It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson. The breakfast included waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy as well as cold cereals and oatmeal. The property is on a steep hill, so park closer to the street and use the stairs closer to the front so you'll have fewer flights of stairs to climb. The only complaint we had was that our room's carpet was dirty, evidently from what the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with. We would stay here again though.",Family Vacation to Branson
3,We stayed recently just to take our kids to Silver Dollar City. This is a motel and it is very noisy until at least 11:00 PM. The rooms are fine enough. Breakfast is a scrum of 15-25 people trying to get at the food while you are dodging small children. There are a lot of kids so don't stay if you aren't into the kid scene.,Recent stay
4,Very helpful staff,Nice place near all attractions
3,It was just ok. Would try to stay some where else next time.,Nice place near all attractions
5,"Clean and comfortable, nice hotel for its price range, good location--we enjoyed our 2-night stay. FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!) Overall, our three-room party of extended family had a good experience, and would stay again.",Fine for family fun :)
4,My family enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and the price definitely made it worthwhile. We would stay here again.,Nice little family getaway
4,Staff helpful and informative- room clean. Kids enjoy the pool area.,Nice hotel- close to attractions...staff helpful.
5,A great place to stay. Great people there.,Book this one !
4,"This hotel was rented for a couple on vacation from Illinois. We are a young couple so money is tight. This hotel was decent and the price could not be beat. The room was a little dirty (like the floor, for example) but I expected it. I do have a few things to caution you of: -The continental breakfast is less than stellar, but it gets the job done -Rooms by the pool are loud",Good place for the price!
4,The hotel was very clean and well kept during our stay there. The pool was a decent size and very clean. The breakfast left a little to be desired. Overall for the price it was great. I would stay there again.,Good place for the price!
2,I was very disappointed. The reservation was messed up when I got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me pay cash as first agreed on. And then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though I had not requested it and I had to do my own calling to get problem corrected and I am still not sure it is fixed. Very unhappy with all of it. Room not comfortable. Spider was in my towel. And it did not help to have a room for someone with walking handicap because I had to walk up an incline on the driveway to get to my room. I will never use hotels.com again nor will I ever stay at this motel again. Ever!!!,Dissatisfied in Branson
3,room was clean breakfast was good stayed 4 days same breakfast every day was good away from attractions which was good no traffic but couldnt walk to anything which was bad but was in central location so it was easy to drive to,Dissatisfied in Branson
4,"The staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms were clean, but the beds weren't all that comfortable.The pool was small but clean. I will stay again if we ever go back.",Family getaway
3,"For starters, hotel staff was great. Very pleasant. However, upon entering the room, I discovered that it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was a bit dated. When I woke the next morning, I could see sunshine coming through the edges of the door. While I wasn't concerned for my safety, I did wonder how many bugs were coming to visit me during the night!!","Decent hotel. Needs some refurb, though."
4,"have stayed there before.... Clean, continental breakfast is a continental breakfast..... quiet. and easy to get in and out of. Beginning to need some make over from the amount of traffice it serves.....",Nice Motel out of the main traffice..easy to find
5,"Very enjoyable stay. Room very clean and comfortable, staff were very accommodating, excellent breakfast .",Nice 3 days.
4,"The stay at this hotel was a good experience for me and our entourage. Room was decent and in a quiet area. Staff was good, but the hotel needs to better improve their handicapped parking area near the main entrance.",Good hotel
3,Older hotel that could use some refreshing. Initial room smelled of cat urine. Comforter was old and tattered. Sitting chairs were stained. Staff was helpful. Moved to another room w/o incident. Overall satisfaction was fair. For a few dollars more could get something nicer. Breakfast was very good.,Dated but adequate
5,"Great price thru Hotels.com, manager could not believe the rate. Not on the strip, convenient access to Hwy 76, Shows Silver Dollar City. Breakfast was better than most motel breakfasts.",Great proce from Hotels.com
5,Hot breakfast was great! Staff pleasant and accommodating. Great location with new restaurant next door. Outdoor pool was clean. Free Wi-Fi was hit with the kids. Would stay there again.,Family vacation
5,"Affordable place to stay. Coffee pot in room, fridge clean but a little outdated",Good value
4,"It has been years since I've stayed in a Day's inn but based on the rate and location I decided to go ahead and book my room there. I was very pleasantly surprised. I expected a very basic motel and was surprised at the spaciousness and quality of the room and extra perks, eg. breakfast, refrig. etc. I will certainly consider staying at a Days Inn again.",Surprised
2,"Managet talked over us and wouldnt listen 2 us. Put us n wrong room. Bed was a bowl and killed our back and hips. 2nd room ac didnt work right, bathroom door didnt shut all the way, bathroom vent sounded like a freight train, could hear vents n other rooms.",Horrible
5,Very nice and Drafts Pub Grille just opened next door. Very handy.,Off the beaten path
5,Nice hotel for the price. The staff was very friendly with a great attitude. The only bad thing I can say about my stay was the fitted sheets for the king size bed didn't fit and I had to keep waking up to put them back on,Friendly staff
4,"This hotel was great. Nice area, clean, and close to strip and outlet stores. Only negative was the the shower head needed to be a foot higher. Im 6ft and I had a hard time washing my hair. Any taller than 5'7, you will have some trouble showering here. Other than that, I would of given this hotel a 5 but I would stay here again.",Shower head problem
4,It was a good stay. Didn't stay in room much for all the shopping and Silver Dollar City. Was so glad they have football channels so we could was our team win. This is the first hotel that the refrigerator kept our drinks and food cold. Sink water was hard to turn on and then it would spray water on you. Would stay there again.,Branson get away.
4,"We had a great stay. I definitely appreciated having the a/c cranked up when I walked into the room, especially since it was 100 that day! Room was comfortable and decent rate. Thanks!",Great place to stay
4,Front desk was friendly and helpful! Discovered a waterfall hiking trail around the corner where we could walk dogs. Great biscuits and gravy breakfast!,"Comfort, good biscuits and gravy, Dog Friendly!"
2,1 of the queen beds was broken in room. Very uncomfortable sleep that night.,Bed bad
5,The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast food was more than I expected. Everything was great.,A very relaxing stay.
2,It was way to loud and no way we could have got into the pool. If I was you I would never go without shoes in the room the carpet was so nasty. And the rooms seem very dark.,It was so loud and there was no way we could have
5,Everything about this hotel was great. It was convenient to many activities. Good free breakfast selection. We did not have an opportunity to use the pool because of the weather.,mini family vacation
5,My wife and I stayed here recently on our first visit to Branson. The room was clean and updated. The breakfast in the morning was ample and lots of variety. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We booked a show through the hotel at the tribute theater that was a hoot. I would definitely stay here again. Would be a good central location if I was staying with my whole family also. Lots to do in the area.,"Great value for the money, a little off the strip."
2,"We thought the hotel was a little tired looking. Drawer handles on the dresser were loose, things like that. The breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The maid service was not very thorough at times, i.e. pulling the sheet up and tucking it in without making sure the mattress pad was in place.",Probably would not choose this hotel again.
5,All facilities including Swimming Pool are very clean. Staff are very friendly. Hotel is centrally located.Great Value for Money.,The Breakfast was served throughout the Day
2,"Hotel is in bad need of repair. Room was old, sink had damage, trim falling apart in bathroom , shower curtain bar so loose, shower curtain was at my feet, yuck.Bed ancient with icky old bed spreads. Should be put in one star category. The staff was the best part of this place.","It will do for the night, over paid."
3,Decent. Good location. Made it easy to get around Branson.,"It will do for the night, over paid."
5,"The staff were very friendly and courteous,room were clean and the facilities in the hotel good. The continental breakfast has a wide range of choices.",Nice hotel
4,"The Hotel was a little dated but still in pretty good condition. The breakfast was outstanding and had a great selection. The eating area was a little small for the crowd that came to breakfast, it just shows how good it was. I would stay here again and I will recommend it to friends and family.",Nice hotel
2,The room was simple for the trip but didn't like the fact that the room didn't include a microwave which should be standard,inadequate room amenities
2,"Let's start with the positives. Great location to everything and the staff were super friendly. Now the negatives. Dated and a bit worn, not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either. There were bugs in the room. The kind that fly and some in the bed. We were very displeased and embarrassed. I will not return.",Dated and worn
4,"There was a mix-up with Hotel.com, but the hotel staff connected with Hotel.com and both businesses worked it out for us. We highly appreciated that. We were given a room close to Lobby and over the pool, so it was a rather noisy room, but very convenient for our needs. The hotel couldn't help that the volley ball team yelled and ran up down stairs balconies. Just what one has to put up with during the busiest tourist season. However, with the help of the continuous running fan, the wonderful soft bed pillows being so tired, we rested very well. Breakfast was good had something for the diabetic diet, but super crowded. Probably half the folks had to take breakfast back to their rooms.",Enjoyed our stay.
3,"We rented 2 rooms with double beds, in both rooms the beds were very worn out. NOT COMFORTABLE.",Enjoyed our stay.
3,"I went to Branson for 4th of July so there were VERY few affordable options as every hotel raised it's prices. I paid close to double the price of what this hotel normally goes for. So I was already paying more than I should (beds and pillows were very uncomfortable) and on top of it, they have a ridiculous pet policy. 10 extra per night is not bad - it's the mandatory 50 cleaning fee whether the animal makes a mess or not. Paid way more than I should for an establishment that did not earn that value.",Good location for average accomodation
4,"Nothing fancy but met our needs. Quiet, convient and staff very friendly and helpful. Beds were very comfortable.",Good location for average accomodation
4,none,great price
4,Our room was not ready until an hour and a half after check in. Then when we went to check out the next morning I waited 5 minutes or so before anyone came to the desk to check me out.,great price
3,Price was a deal. Serving the breakfast saved us a lot of money. The family enjoyed their stay.,Family Vacation
3,"Not deluxe but clean and quiet with friendly, competent staff. Good value.",Branson visit
4,Everyone was very friendly. Breakfast area a little crowded. Overall a good stay.,Fall break
4,"Clean room, good breakfast, easy access.",Good place
4,Stay was very enjoyable. Hotel staff was friendly and always busy. We will definitely considering booking another stay when in the area.,All Good!
